Styling is essential part of every web application, so we tried to make it as fact and convenient as possible, with the help of [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/) library. It provides huge variety of customizable components and hooks.

Mantine's [theme object](https://mantine.dev/theming/theme-object/) makes it possible to build your own design system on top of library.

## Examples

```tsx
import { Button, Center, Container, Image, Stack, Text } from "@mantine/core";

const PaymentSuccess: NextPage = () => {
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    console.log("Hello");
  }, []);

  return (
    <Center>
      <Container
        m="32px 0 0"
        p="md"
        bg="white"
        maw={480}
        w="100%"
      >
        <Stack spacing={32} align="center">
          <Image
            src="../images/payment_error.png"
            alt="payment error"
            height={48}
            width={48}
          />
          <Stack spacing="sm" align="center">
            <Text weight={600} size="lg">
              Payment Failed
            </Text>
            <Text weight={400} size="sm" color="black.3">
              Sorry, your payment failed.
              <br />
              Would you like to try again?
            </Text>
          </Stack>
          <Button
            h={40}
            w={186}
            size="xs"
            bg="blue.5"
            radius={8}
            onClick={handleClick}
          >
            Back to Cart
          </Button>
        </Stack>
      </Container>
    </Center>
  );
};
```
