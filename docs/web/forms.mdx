## Overview

To make process of building and handling forms easier, we're using [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) library with the combination of [@hookform/resolvers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hookform/resolvers). With this combination you can build robust forms with no time.

### Form schema

[@hookform/resolvers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hookform/resolvers) package provides way of validating your forms with Zod schema. Simply write Zod schema for your form and provide it as resolver option of useFrom hook. It's also convenient that you can infer type from schema and here is your perfectly typed form.

```typescript
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";
import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod";

const schema = z.object({
  firstName: z.string().min(1, "Please enter First name").max(100),
  lastName: z.string().min(1, "Please enter Last name").max(100),
  email: z.string().regex(EMAIL_REGEX, "Email format is incorrect."),
});

type FormParams = z.infer<typeof schema>;

const Page = () => {
  const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm<FormParams>({
    resolver: zodResolver(schema),
  });

  // your code here
};
```
